As you all know Digo is not just a programmer, he is also a microbiologist. Recently he created a new virus which replicates very quickly. To be precise, if we have a virus at a particular point (x,y) then in one minute it dies and just before dying it gives birth to four other viruses which will be born at (x,y+1), (x,y-1), (x+1,y), and (x-1,y). Note that there maybe more than one virus at any point and they behave independent of each other.

Let us consider an infinite cartesian plane. Initially at time t = 0 minutes, Digo placed a virus at (0,0) and wonders how they might grow in number. Your task is very simple. You have to answer Q queries. Each query is represented as "x y z" (quotes for clarity) for which you have to find how many viruses infest the point (x,y) after z minutes.
As the answer can be huge so output it modulo 10^8 + 2013.

Input:

On the first line there will be an integer Q, representing the number of queries. 
Q lines follow each having three integers x, y, z where (x,y) is the point under consideration and x represents the time elapsed from the start.
 
Output:

Output Q numbers each of them answering the queries given in the input. The ith number should answer the ith query.

Constraints:

1 <= Q <= 10^5
1 <= x,y <= 10^6
1 <= z <= 2*(10^6)
0 <= answer < 100002013
